# 1D Fuel Plate Simulator

Originally meant to write base code in Fortran, but had a few problems installing
gfortran on Windows, decided to move on to writing the code to Python due timing.

_Warning_ Code is not complete.

# Compiling

```
gfortran -o simulator.exe  simulator.f18
```

# Running

```

Then proceed to input parameters as prompted.
